        <h1>Jain Nav Tattva Principle: A Detailed Understanding</h1>

        <section>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In Jain philosophy, the knowledge of the nine Tattvas (principles) is considered extremely essential for the welfare of the soul and the attainment of liberation (Moksha). These nine Tattvas explain the nature of all substances in the universe and guide the soul to understand its true self, showing the path to freedom from the sufferings of the world. In this report, we will understand the principle of the Jain Nav Tattva in a beautiful and simple language, with its definitions, important points, and practical examples.</p>

            <p>In the world, there are mainly two types of substances: Jiva (soul) and Ajiva (non-soul). To understand the interrelationship of these two fundamental Tattvas and the resulting consequences, the Omniscient Lords (Jinvar Parmatma) expounded the nine Tattvas. The accurate knowledge of these nine Tattvas and faith in them is indispensable for the attainment of Samyag Darshan (right faith), which is the first step on the path to Moksha.</p>

            <p>The nine Tattvas are as follows:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Jiva (Soul)</li>
                <li>Ajiva (Non-soul)</li>
                <li>Punya (Merit or good karma)</li>
                <li>Papa (Demerit or bad karma)</li>
                <li>Ashrava (Influx of karma)</li>
                <li>Samvara (Stoppage of karmic influx)</li>
                <li>Nirjara (Dissipation of karma)</li>
                <li>Bandha (Bondage of karma)</li>
                <li>Moksha (Complete liberation from karma)</li>
            </ol>

            <p>These nine Tattvas are primarily viewed from three perspectives:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>**Gneya (Worth knowing):** Jiva and Ajiva Tattvas.</li>
                <li>**Upadeya (Worth accepting or adopting):** Punya, Samvara, Nirjara, and Moksha Tattvas.</li>
                <li>**Heya (Worth abandoning):** Papa, Ashrava, and Bandha Tattvas.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>However, from the perspective of Nishchaya Naya (real or transcendental viewpoint), Punya is also a type of Ashrava and thus worth abandoning. But from the perspective of Vyavahara Naya (practical or conventional viewpoint), Punya, in the form of Shubha Pravritti (auspicious activities), is considered Upadeya in the initial stages for progressing on the path of Dharma and avoiding inauspicious activities.</p>

            <h2>1. Jiva Tattva</h2>
            <div class="definition">
                <h3>Definition:</h3>
                <p>That which is characterized by consciousness, which lives, which possesses life forces (pranas), and is endowed with the utilization of knowledge and perception, is Jiva. Jiva is an eternal, beginningless, endless, and formless substance. Due to the conjunction with karmas, it becomes embodied and transmigrates through the four states of existence (Deva, Manushya, Tiryanch, Naraka) in the world.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="important-points">
                <h3>Important Points:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The main characteristic of Jiva is **Upayoga (utilization of consciousness)**, which manifests as knowledge and perception. No Jiva is ever without Upayoga.</li>
                    <li>There are mainly 14 types of worldly Jivas, based on senses (indriya), bodies (kaya), complete development (paryapti), and mental faculty (sangya):
                        <ul>
                            <li>One-sensed (subtle and gross - complete/incomplete) - 4 types</li>
                            <li>Two-sensed (gross - complete/incomplete) - 2 types</li>
                            <li>Three-sensed (gross - complete/incomplete) - 2 types</li>
                            <li>Four-sensed (gross - complete/incomplete) - 2 types</li>
                            <li>Five-sensed (with mind and without mind - complete/incomplete) - 4 types</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Jiva possesses 10 life forces (pranas): 5 senses (touch, taste, smell, sight, hearing), 3 powers (mind, speech, body), respiration, and lifespan.</li>
                    <li>Jiva has the potential to complete 6 development potentials (paryaptis): food, body, senses, respiration, speech, and mind. A Jiva that completes its potential developments is called Paryapta (complete), and one that dies before completing them is called Aparyapta (incomplete).</li>
                    <li>**Sangyi Jivas** are those with a mind and can think about what is beneficial and harmful, while **Asangyi Jivas** are without a mind.</li>
                    <li>**Sukshma Jivas (Subtle)** are not visible to the senses and are pervasive throughout the entire universe, while **Badar Jivas (Gross)** are perceptible to the senses.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="practical-examples">
                <h3>Practical Examples:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The soul residing in our body is Jiva.</li>
                    <li>Humans, animals, birds, celestial beings (Devas), and infernal beings (Narakis) are different types of Jivas.</li>
                    <li>Earth, water, fire, air, and plants also contain Jivas, which are called one-sensed Jivas.</li>
                    <li>Organisms like conch shells, oysters, and earthworms are two-sensed.</li>
                    <li>Ants, termites, and bedbugs are three-sensed.</li>
                    <li>Mosquitoes, flies, and butterflies are four-sensed.</li>
                    <li>Humans, cows, lions, fish, Devas, and Narakis are five-sensed. Sangyi five-sensed beings can think, like humans.</li>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The knowledge of the Jain Nav Tattva is the foundation of soul's welfare. By accurately understanding these Tattvas, and through the discriminative knowledge of Jiva and Ajiva, the true nature of the soul can be recognized. By knowing the nature of Punya and Papa, one can avoid Papa and engage in Punya. By considering Ashrava as Heya, the influx of karmas can be stopped through Samvara, and the bound karmas can be dissipated through Nirjara. Ultimately, by destroying all karmas, the supreme bliss of Moksha can be attained.</p>

            <p>Deep contemplation and reflection on these nine Tattvas lead to the growth of Samyag Darshan, Gyan, and Charitra in life, and the soul can progress on the path to Moksha. By incorporating this principle expounded by the Omniscient Lords into our lives, we too can achieve the welfare of our soul.</p>

            <p>The knowledge of the nine Tattvas is not merely a verbal understanding, but putting it into practice in life is its true fruit. When the Jiva internalizes the nature of these nine Tattvas, it understands the reality of the world. It understands that happiness and sorrow are not in external objects, but are due to its own karmas. This understanding motivates it to stay away from sinful activities and engage in auspicious activities.</p>

            <p>By knowing the nature of Ashrava and Bandha, the Jiva tries to close the doors of karmic influx, which is Samvara. Through Samvara, the binding of new karmas is stopped. Simultaneously, through Tapa and Samyama, it dissipates the previously bound karmas (Nirjara). Through this process, the soul becomes lighter from the burden of karmas and progresses towards purity.</p>

            <p>Finally, when the soul is completely liberated from karmas, it attains the supreme state of Moksha. This state is one of infinite bliss, knowledge, and peace. The knowledge of the nine Tattvas clearly shows this path to Moksha and guides the Jiva to reach this ultimate goal.</p>

            <p>Thus, the Jain Nav Tattva principle is not just a religious doctrine, but it is the art of living and the path of self-development. By understanding these Tattvas and having faith in them, we can make our lives more meaningful and embark on the sacred path to Moksha.</p>
